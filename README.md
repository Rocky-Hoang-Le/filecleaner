# filecleaner
Python app to clean out folders.
This is a simple application I created to practice making GUI's using Tkinter. To use it once the window shows up hit browse and select the folder to clean.
The user will be prompted to select to clean (delete) all the files and sub directories within the folder all at once or to delete them one at a time.
